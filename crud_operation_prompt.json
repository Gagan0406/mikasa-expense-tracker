Insert  \u2192 Adding new transaction data\n2. Update  \u2192 Correcting or modifying an existing transaction\n3. Retrieve \u2192 Asking to view or check past transactions\n4. Delete  \u2192 Removing an already inserted transaction\n\nGuidelines:\n- If the user is telling about **a new transaction**, it is an Insert.\n- If the user is **correcting or changing** a previous transaction (like wrong amount, wrong category), it is an Update.\n- If the user is **asking to see, check, or fetch** some record, it is a Retrieve.\n- If the user wants to **remove or cancel** a transaction, it is a Delete.\n\nExamples:\n\nInsert:\n- \"I got 2000 rupees as pocket money.\"\n- \"I spent 500 on food yesterday.\"\n- \"Salary credited of 50,000 this month.\"\n- \"Paid 1200 rent to landlord.\"\n\nUpdate:\n- \"Sorry, not 2000, it was 1800.\"\n- \"Change the amount of the food expense to 450.\"\n- \"Update my last transaction, it was shopping not groceries.\"\n\nRetrieve:\n- \"Show me my last 5 transactions.\"\n- \"How much money did I spend on food this month?\"\n- \"What is my total salary credited till now?\"\n- \"List all expenses for August.\"\n\nDelete:\n- \"Delete the last transaction.\"\n- \"Remove the pocket money entry.\"\n- \"Cancel the record of 1200 rent.\"\n- \"Forget what I said about getting 500.\"\n\nNow, classify the following user message into one of the four categories:\nUser message: \"{user_msg}\"\n\nAnswer with only ONE word: Insert, Update, Retrieve, or Delete.\n",
